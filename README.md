# EDA-Internet_addictors - for univariate analysis
As a junior data scientist, focusing on utilizing Plotly and Polars for this EDA project using the dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muhammadroshaanriaz/time-wasters-on-social-media) represents a deliberate choice. While Pandas and Matplotlib are robust tools for exploratory data analysis (EDA), Plotly introduces interactive and visually appealing features, enhancing the ability to create dynamic visualizations that facilitate deeper exploration and understanding of the data.

Moreover, Polars offers efficient data manipulation capabilities, emphasizing performance and scalability, which are particularly valuable when handling large datasets or conducting computationally intensive tasks. By integrating Plotly for interactive visualizations and Polars for optimized data processing, this project aims to not only uncover insights into time-wasting behaviors on social media but also to demonstrate advanced analytical techniques that leverage the strengths of these tools. This approach not only enhances the presentation of findings but also maximizes computational efficiency, thereby demonstrating a comprehensive approach to data exploration and analysis in this domain.

However, it's important to note that Plotly visualizations won't render directly on GitHub due to its nature of creating dynamic and interactive plots. To view these Plotly visualizations, it's recommended to pull the repository and execute the code locally on your machine or download the HTML file or click this link(https://nbviewer.org/github/EasonChen-GH/EDA-Internet_addictors/blob/main/Internet%20addictor.ipynb). This approach allows you to fully interact with the plots, exploring the data dynamically as intended. By running the code locally, you can also ensure that any dependencies or configurations specific to your environment are properly set up, optimizing the experience of exploring the EDA project based on the dataset from Kaggle on time-wasters on social media.
